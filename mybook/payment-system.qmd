title: "Payment System"
---

Build a payment interface that can deal with fake cash (better if you can deal with real currency, although I don't know if you have to take extra steps for that). Users should be able to receive and send money, and also check their current balance.

## Python Implementation

```python
def payment_system():
    """
    Implementation for Payment System
    """
    print("Executing Payment System...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    payment_system()
```
