title: "Pixel Art Generator"
---

Code a script that takes in a picture and then creates the Pixel Art from the image. You can achieve this by downsizing the image. You should also be able to generate random art using this script.

## Python Implementation

```python
def pixel_art_generator():
    """
    Implementation for Pixel Art Generator
    """
    print("Executing Pixel Art Generator...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pixel_art_generator()
```
