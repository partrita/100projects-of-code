title: "Math Editor"
---

Build an app that will properly format equations that a user inputs. I personally find it really inconvenient to work with a special software to just write and display equations properly like Latex, thus, if you build something that can convert plain English text to properly formatted equations, ping me!

## Python Implementation

```python
def math_editor():
    """
    Implementation for Math Editor
    """
    print("Executing Math Editor...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    math_editor()
```
