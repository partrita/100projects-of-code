title: "Blog"

A blog is a must have for everyone (according to me). Combine that fact with the fact that you learn a lot of things while building your own blog from scratch, and voila!

## Python Implementation

```python
def blog():
    """
    Implementation for Blog
    """
    print("Executing Blog...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    blog()
```
