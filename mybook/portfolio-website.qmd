title: "Portfolio Website"
---

If you are ever interested in showcasing the things you have built, build a portfolio website! Building a website to display all the stuff will teach you a lot about website design in general (if you've never built a website before).

## Python Implementation

```python
def portfolio_website():
    """
    Implementation for Portfolio Website
    """
    print("Executing Portfolio Website...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    portfolio_website()
```
