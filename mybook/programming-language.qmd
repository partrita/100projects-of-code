title: "Programming Language"
---

Code a programming language from scratch. This project will give you great insights into why languages are structured the way they are and which languages suit which tasks better. There are quite a few programming languages, thus, incorporate some really weird (or helpful) features to make your language stand out (e.g. check out [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck)).

## Python Implementation

```python
def programming_language():
    """
    Implementation for Programming Language
    """
    print("Executing Programming Language...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    programming_language()
```
