title: "Packet Sniffer"
---

A packet sniffer is used to monitor network traffic by examining streams of data packets that flow between computers on a network. To start with the project, study network protocols properly. Then dive into implementing an application that tracks down network packets and parses its content in a human readable form.

## Python Implementation

```python
def packet_sniffer():
    """
    Implementation for Packet Sniffer
    """
    print("Executing Packet Sniffer...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    packet_sniffer()
```
