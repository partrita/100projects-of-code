title: "Port Scanner"
---

Build a port scanner application that can probe a server or host for open ports. You will need some technical knowledge regarding how networks work and how you can scan for ports or classify them.

## Python Implementation

```python
def port_scanner():
    """
    Implementation for Port Scanner
    """
    print("Executing Port Scanner...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    port_scanner()
```
