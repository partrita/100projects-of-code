title: "Bandwidth Monitor"
---

Build a tool to track how much data you have downloaded or uploaded to the internet. Have it email you weekly reports of your usage (or notify you when you get above a specified usage limit). As a bonus challenge, predict peak usage times.

## Python Implementation

```python
def bandwidth_monitor():
    """
    Implementation for Bandwidth Monitor
    """
    print("Executing Bandwidth Monitor...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    bandwidth_monitor()
```
