title: "Spoiler Blocker"
---

Build a browser extension that blocks movie spoilers on websites. I put it in AI as you have to think of a changing algorithm that should be smart enough to identify spoilers from a piece of text.

## Python Implementation

```python
def spoiler_blocker():
    """
    Implementation for Spoiler Blocker
    """
    print("Executing Spoiler Blocker...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    spoiler_blocker()
```
