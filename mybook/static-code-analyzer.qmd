title: "Static Code Analyzer"
---

Make a software that will go through your code (without executing it) and check for any inconsistencies or errors (syntax errors, indentation, etc) that may cause any problems during execution.

## Python Implementation

```python
def static_code_analyzer():
    """
    Implementation for Static Code Analyzer
    """
    print("Executing Static Code Analyzer...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    static_code_analyzer()
```
