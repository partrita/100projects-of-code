title: "Simulate the World"
---

Build a simulation of the whole world. Try to be as detailed as you can. Keep it simple when you feel stuck and slowly improve on it. Treat it as a self-sustaining game if it makes things easier. For bonus points, add an AI to the system to let it work on its own.

## Python Implementation

```python
def simulate_the_world():
    """
    Implementation for Simulate the World
    """
    print("Executing Simulate the World...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simulate_the_world()
```
