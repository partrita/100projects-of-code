title: "Tic Tac Toe"
---

Build a CLI app for tic-tac-toe or a graphical interface. One of the interesting ideas is to let the user draw Xs and Os and then let the machine automatically identify if you drew an X or an O.

## Python Implementation

```python
def tic_tac_toe():
    """
    Implementation for Tic Tac Toe
    """
    print("Executing Tic Tac Toe...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tic_tac_toe()
```
