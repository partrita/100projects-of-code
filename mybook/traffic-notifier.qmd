title: "Traffic Notifier"
---

Build an app (phone app will be better) that finds how congested one route is and then suggests you a better route to take to your destination.

## Python Implementation

```python
def traffic_notifier():
    """
    Implementation for Traffic Notifier
    """
    print("Executing Traffic Notifier...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    traffic_notifier()
```
