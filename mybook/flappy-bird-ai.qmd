title: "Flappy Bird AI"
---

Design an AI for the flappy bird game. Try out a few learning algorithms to train your network - Q-Learning, NEAT, etc. Build the perfect AI that will play flappy bird better than you (or anyone else) ever can.

## Python Implementation

```python
def flappy_bird_ai():
    """
    Implementation for Flappy Bird AI
    """
    print("Executing Flappy Bird AI...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flappy_bird_ai()
```
