title: "Pathfinding Visualizer"
---

Make a visualizer for the different pathfinding algorithms. Add this to a maze maker and you have a program that can generate and solve mazes.

## Python Implementation

```python
def pathfinding_visualizer():
    """
    Implementation for Pathfinding Visualizer
    """
    print("Executing Pathfinding Visualizer...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pathfinding_visualizer()
```
