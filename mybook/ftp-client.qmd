title: "FTP Client"
---

A simple File Transfer client that uses the FTP (File Transfer Protocol). As a bonus challenge, add support for secure file transfer. It can be a web, desktop, or CLI app.
You can try to first implement TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) as it's easier.

## Python Implementation

```python
def ftp_client():
    """
    Implementation for FTP Client
    """
    print("Executing FTP Client...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    ftp_client()
```
