title: "Chatbot"
---

Build a chatbot that you can talk to when bored. For bonus points use machine learning/AI to make it smart. I suggest you to implement it as a simple CLI application.

## Python Implementation

```python
def chatbot():
    """
    Implementation for Chatbot
    """
    print("Executing Chatbot...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()
```
