title: "Directory Tree Generator"
---

Generate a tree like structure using the directories present in a given path by the user. This allows you to see the positioning of files and directories. We are visual animals and thus, visual depictions of directories are more understandable.

## Python Implementation

```python
def directory_tree_generator():
    """
    Implementation for Directory Tree Generator
    """
    print("Executing Directory Tree Generator...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory_tree_generator()
```
