title: "Application Builder"
---

This is probably the hardest one on the list and the most vague one too. Design a system that takes in text input and generates applications (or at least application interfaces) based on the text description. You can also use a drag-and-drop like feature to let users build the app.

## Python Implementation

```python
def application_builder():
    """
    Implementation for Application Builder
    """
    print("Executing Application Builder...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    application_builder()
```
