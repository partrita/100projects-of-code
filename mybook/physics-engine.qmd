title: "Physics Engine"

Video Games work on [physics engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics_engine). Build your own. You can later use this engine to build games or carry out simulations. Try building a 2D or 3D physics engine that can handle collision, movement, acceleration, gravity, and other forces in the system. You may need to first understand a bit of physics to be able to build something, so take your time for this one.

## Python Implementation

```python
def physics_engine():
    """
    Implementation for Physics Engine
    """
    print("Executing Physics Engine...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    physics_engine()
```
