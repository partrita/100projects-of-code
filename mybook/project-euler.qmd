title: "Project Euler"
---

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) contains mathematical challenges that require programming tools to be solved. There are over 700 problems that you can solve, I urge you to document each solution in a properly organized way (probably build a repo for the solutions) so that you can showcase them online.

## Python Implementation

```python
def project_euler():
    """
    Implementation for Project Euler
    """
    print("Executing Project Euler...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    project_euler()
```
