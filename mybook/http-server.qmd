title: "HTTP Server"
---

To understand HTTP better, you need to build an HTTP server. It's not much difficult now a days (with the wealth of information around us).

## Python Implementation

```python
def http_server():
    """
    Implementation for HTTP Server
    """
    print("Executing HTTP Server...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    http_server()
```
