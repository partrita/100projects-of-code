Try coding the classic board game of [Risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_(game)). Make sure you know all the rules and understand the game properly before you code it.

## Python Implementation

```python
def risk():
    """
    Implementation for Risk
    """
    print("Executing Risk...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    risk()
```
