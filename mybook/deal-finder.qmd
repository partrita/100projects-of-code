title: "Deal Finder"
---

Build a simple web app to notify you when an item you covet goes on sale for a good price. You can use a web scraper to pull the item's product page and notify you of any price changes.

## Python Implementation

```python
def deal_finder():
    """
    Implementation for Deal Finder
    """
    print("Executing Deal Finder...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    deal_finder()
```
