title: "Sorting Visualizer"
---

Build a webpage/video that will visualize the different sorting algorithms. You can use different kinds of visualizations: dots, bars, colour bars, circularly scattered points, and so on.

## Python Implementation

```python
def sorting_visualizer():
    """
    Implementation for Sorting Visualizer
    """
    print("Executing Sorting Visualizer...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sorting_visualizer()
```
