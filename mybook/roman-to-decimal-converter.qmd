title: "Roman to Decimal Converter"
---

Write a script that converts decimal numbers to roman numerals and vice versa. This may seem like an easy task but I assure you its not that easy. Give it a try.

## Python Implementation

```python
def roman_to_decimal_converter():
    """
    Implementation for Roman to Decimal Converter
    """
    print("Executing Roman to Decimal Converter...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    roman_to_decimal_converter()
```
