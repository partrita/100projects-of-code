title: "Tetris"
---

Code the game of Tetris starting from the Tetrominoes to the game interface. A web app is better as it will let you play from anywhere. For additional challenge try to implement a simple HTML and JavaScript version without any additional frameworks or libraries to help.

## Python Implementation

```python
def tetris():
    """
    Implementation for Tetris
    """
    print("Executing Tetris...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tetris()
```
