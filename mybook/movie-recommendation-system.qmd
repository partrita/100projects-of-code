title: "Movie Recommendation System"
---

Build a recommendation system that lets you or any users choose the next movie that you want to watch. Instead of copying an existing movie recommender with a well studied algorithm, try to come up with your own algorithm and test it out.

## Python Implementation

```python
def movie_recommendation_system():
    """
    Implementation for Movie Recommendation System
    """
    print("Executing Movie Recommendation System...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    movie_recommendation_system()
```
