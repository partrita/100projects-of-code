title: "Build an OS"
---

This project will be technically challenging and will deepen your understanding of how computers and operating systems work. Building an OS from the ground up is a really daunting task but you will surely find a way to do it.

## Python Implementation

```python
def build_an_os():
    """
    Implementation for Build an OS
    """
    print("Executing Build an OS...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    build_an_os()
```
