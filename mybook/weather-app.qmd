title: "Weather App"
---

Build an app that gets the weather at your location in the current time. You can either use a web scraper in the background to collect the data or use a weather API.

## Python Implementation

```python
def weather_app():
    """
    Implementation for Weather App
    """
    print("Executing Weather App...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    weather_app()
```
