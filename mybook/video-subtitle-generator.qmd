title: "Video Subtitle Generator"
---

Input a video and get a subtitle! Build a software that automatically creates subtitles from a provided video. It may seem difficult in the beginning, but look up Natural Language Processing to see how far machines already are with regard to understanding human language.

## Python Implementation

```python
def video_subtitle_generator():
    """
    Implementation for Video Subtitle Generator
    """
    print("Executing Video Subtitle Generator...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    video_subtitle_generator()
```
