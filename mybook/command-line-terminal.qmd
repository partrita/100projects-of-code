title: "Command Line Terminal"
---

If you are building the Operating System, you will surely need a Command Line Terminal. Try to clone the bash shell or Windows PowerShell as an independent project to make it easier while you build your own OS.

## Python Implementation

```python
def command_line_terminal():
    """
    Implementation for Command Line Terminal
    """
    print("Executing Command Line Terminal...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    command_line_terminal()
```
