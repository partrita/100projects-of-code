title: "Grammar Checker"
---

Build a software that will spell check and check simple grammatical errors in any text you write. For additional points/complexity, try to guess the mood (happy text, formal letter, etc) of the text and suggest appropriate changes.

## Python Implementation

```python
def grammar_checker():
    """
    Implementation for Grammar Checker
    """
    print("Executing Grammar Checker...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    grammar_checker()
```
