Code the game of chess from the ground up. Build a board, the pieces (you can use images for this part). Code in the rules and make sure you allow no invalid moves.

## Python Implementation

```python
def chess():
    """
    Implementation for Chess
    """
    print("Executing Chess...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    chess()
```
