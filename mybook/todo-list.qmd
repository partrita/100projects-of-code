title: "ToDo List"
---

Build a To Do app that can track the various stages of a given work (todo, ongoing, completed). For bonus points, make it work with recurring tasks and incorporate task scheduling (when to do what/a deadline for tasks).

## Python Implementation

```python
def todo_list():
    """
    Implementation for ToDo List
    """
    print("Executing ToDo List...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    todo_list()
```
