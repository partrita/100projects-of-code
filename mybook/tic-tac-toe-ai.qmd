title: "Tic Tac Toe AI"
---

Build an AI that is unbeatable (either wins always or at least draws) in tic-tac-toe. Instead of just hardcoding what move to play when, build an AI that learns how to play and then devises strategies to win.

## Python Implementation

```python
def tic_tac_toe_ai():
    """
    Implementation for Tic Tac Toe AI
    """
    print("Executing Tic Tac Toe AI...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    tic_tac_toe_ai()
```
