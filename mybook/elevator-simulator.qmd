title: "Elevator Simulator"
---

Build a simulation for an elevator. This may seem like a random simulation, but you need to think a lot before implementing something regarding this, which floor to go to when two buttons are pressed? Is there any change if you add a preference for going up or going down? and so on.

## Python Implementation

```python
def elevator_simulator():
    """
    Implementation for Elevator Simulator
    """
    print("Executing Elevator Simulator...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    elevator_simulator()
```
