title: "Recipe Generator"
---

The app (or service) should generate new recipes/scrapes recipes from the web. So when you cook by its recipe, you rate it to tell it how good the recipe was.

## Python Implementation

```python
def recipe_generator():
    """
    Implementation for Recipe Generator
    """
    print("Executing Recipe Generator...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    recipe_generator()
```
