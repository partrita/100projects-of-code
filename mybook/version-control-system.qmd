Make a proper version control system like git that can keep track of any changes that you make to your project.

## Python Implementation

```python
def version_control_system():
    """
    Implementation for Version Control System
    """
    print("Executing Version Control System...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    version_control_system()
```
