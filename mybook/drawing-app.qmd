title: "Drawing App"
---

Build an app that lets the user draw anything and save it as an image. For extra points, add colouring and other cool things like animations.

## Python Implementation

```python
def drawing_app():
    """
    Implementation for Drawing App
    """
    print("Executing Drawing App...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    drawing_app()
```
