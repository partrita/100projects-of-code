Build a spam classifier that filters ads and other unrequired emails from people that you don't really want to look at.

## Python Implementation

```python
def spam_classifier():
    """
    Implementation for Spam Classifier
    """
    print("Executing Spam Classifier...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    spam_classifier()
```
