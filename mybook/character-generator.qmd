title: "Character Generator"
---

Build a tool that will generate random characters for games that you play/build like Pathfinder or Divinity: Original Sin. First implement a random character generator and then tweak it to make characters that you will like (add an AI).

## Python Implementation

```python
def character_generator():
    """
    Implementation for Character Generator
    """
    print("Executing Character Generator...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    character_generator()
```
