title: "Audio to Sign Language Translator"

Similar to the video translator, but now you need to translate an audio to sign language. The sign language part can be in the form of a series of images or a video.

## Python Implementation

```python
def audio_to_sign_language_translator():
    """
    Implementation for Audio to Sign Language Translator
    """
    print("Executing Audio to Sign Language Translator...")
    # TODO: Add your implementation here
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    audio_to_sign_language_translator()
```
